      - "For thousands of years, civilizations have looked to the movement of the planets to understand events on Earth. Today, we use that same celestial logic to help you navigate the seasons of your life."
      - "Astrology isn't about predicting a fixed future—it is about understanding the cosmic weather so you can prepare for it. From timing big career moves to understanding relationship dynamics, an astrology reading provides the perspective you need to make empowered decisions and align your actions with the universe's natural rhythm."

          Medicine taught me 'how' the body functions, but astrology taught me the 'why' behind our life experiences. My mission is to unite the best of science and spirit to help you find not just health, but meaning in your own story. <br><br>

          I bridge the gap between clinical science and cosmic wisdom. Trained as a Physician, Surgeon, and Public Health Administrator, I bring decades of diagnostic rigor to my Astrology readings. Having guided hundreds of clients and served as an educator at the advanced levels of Academic Medical Astrology, I offer a reading that is not just intuitive, but structured, practical, and precise.
