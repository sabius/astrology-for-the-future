The tablets contain a series of astrological, astronomical, and omen texts, providing insights into the beliefs and practices of the Mesopotamian civilization."

These observations were believed to hold significant influence over human affairs and the destinies of kings. The texts were consulted by diviners and astrologers to gain insight into future events and to guide decision-making."
